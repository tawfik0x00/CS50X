JAVASCRIPT DESCRIPTION

I used JavaScript to add interactivity with three features:
(1) a Dark Mode toggle button that switches the website theme and saves user preference in localStorage,
(2) a one-time welcome alert for first-time visitors, and
(3) a live digital clock in the footer that updates every second.


BOOTSTRAP DESCRIPTION

I integrated Bootstrap 5 via CDN to improve responsiveness and appearance of my website,
using its default button styling, card layout, and spacing utilities for a clean, professional design.
